### RISK & COMPLIANCE


### 1. Legal Risks

**Regulatory Compliance for RWA**

-   Fractional ownership of real estate remains in a regulatory grey area across many jurisdictions. Rules on securitization, foreign ownership, and consumer protection vary significantly.
    
-   **Mitigation:** Makers partners with both international and local legal advisors to ensure compliance with property, securities, and digital asset regulations in each operating jurisdiction.
    

**Ownership & Property Rights**

-   Physical assets (villas) may be subject to government policy changes or legal disputes.
    
-   **Mitigation:** All physical assets will be placed under a **Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)** or dedicated legal entity that directly binds the dNFT to the real-world property.
    

----------

### 2. Market Risks

**Property Value Fluctuations**

-   Real estate value is affected by local property markets, tourism demand, and macroeconomic conditions.
    
-   **Mitigation:** Makers updates asset valuations periodically using independent appraisals to ensure dNFT prices reflect fair market value.
    

**Occupancy & Revenue**

-   Low occupancy rates may reduce distributable revenue for dNFT holders.
    
-   **Mitigation:** Makers employs diversified rental strategies (short-term, long-term, and event-based) combined with professional property management to stabilize occupancy and income streams.
    

----------

### 3. Technology Risks

**Smart Contract Security**

-   Vulnerabilities in smart contracts may lead to financial loss or governance manipulation.
    
-   **Mitigation:** Independent audits, adoption of the **Move framework on SUI** with its resource-based security architecture, and an active bug bounty program.
    

**Blockchain Network Risks**

-   Disruptions or scalability issues within the SUI network could affect dNFT transactions.
    
-   **Mitigation:** Core ownership metadata and transaction history are designed to remain verifiable off-chain, backed by strong on-chain proofs.
    

----------

### 4. Operational Risks

**Property Management**

-   Poor operations (maintenance, guest services, marketing) could reduce asset value and attractiveness.
    
-   **Mitigation:** Makers appoints professional operators with proven track records and provides transparent performance reports to dNFT holders.
    

**Secondary Market Liquidity**

-   While fractional ownership increases accessibility, secondary markets for dNFTs may initially lack sufficient liquidity.
    
-   **Mitigation:** Makers collaborates with RWA marketplaces, DeFi protocols, and global investor communities to enhance liquidity options.
    

----------

### 5. Reputation Risks

**Investor Trust**

-   Failures in transparency, profit distribution, or dispute resolution may erode investor confidence.
    
-   **Mitigation:** Makers ensures verifiable blockchain-based reporting, public auditability, and establishes governance voting as a dispute resolution mechanism.
    

----------

### 6. Compliance Framework

**AML/KYC Integration**

-   All investors must complete **Know Your Customer (KYC)** and **Anti-Money Laundering (AML)** procedures before acquiring dNFTs.
    

**Regulatory Alignment**

-   The Makers business model is aligned with regulatory requirements in both the propertyâ€™s country of origin and the jurisdictions of participating investors.
    

**Audit & Reporting**

-   Regular financial, legal, and operational audits are published to the investor community via a transparent on-chain reporting portal.
