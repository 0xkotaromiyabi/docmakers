Makers emerges as a response to the demand for a more inclusive, transparent, and liquid model of property ownership. By leveraging Sui Move blockchain, Makers introduces **fractional ownership of real estate assets** starting with villas and resorts while paving the way for the broader digitalization of real-world assets.

Through **smart contracts** and **dynamic data integration**, every change in an asset from occupancy to valuation can be tracked in real time. This creates a **data-driven, transparent, and dynamic ownership experience**, positioning Makers beyond traditional property investment models and existing tokenization projects.

**Future Commitments:**

-   **Asset Expansion** – Scaling from the initial 40 villas to premium properties across Bali, major Indonesian cities, and global destinations.
    
-   **Tokenization Facilitator** – Providing an accessible platform for property owners and developers to tokenize assets efficiently, strengthening the RWA ecosystem.
    
-   **Tech Integration** – Adopting IoT, AI, and data oracles for real-time asset monitoring, and integrating with DeFi protocols to unlock liquidity and new asset-backed financial instruments.
    
-   **Global Access** – Enabling cross-border property ownership with simplified, cost-efficient, and bureaucracy-free processes.
    
-   **Sustainability** – Driving tokenization of eco-friendly, green properties in line with global sustainable investment trends.
    

With a **solid technological foundation**, an **innovative ownership model**, and a **vision to be the catalyst of real asset digitalization**, Makers establishes itself as a pioneer in reshaping the global real estate industry. More than just ownership, Makers is about building a **new ecosystem where physical and digital assets coexist seamlessly, securely, and transparently**.
