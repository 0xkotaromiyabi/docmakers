## Solution


## Solution

Makers introduces a transformative approach by leveraging blockchain technology and fractionalized digital representation of real-world assets (RWA).

**Fractional Ownership**  
Each property is represented by digital ownership units that can be held by multiple investors, significantly lowering the capital barrier to entry.

**Enhanced Liquidity**  
By dividing ownership into fractional units, investors can buy, sell, or transfer their stake with far greater speed and flexibility compared to traditional real estate markets.

**Transparency & Traceability**  
All ownership records, asset condition updates, market valuations, and occupancy rates are recorded on-chain, ensuring full visibility and real-time auditability.

**Dynamic Data Representation**  
The platform continuously updates information regarding pricing, property status, and asset performance, giving investors accurate insights for informed decision-making.

**Simplified Administration**  
Through smart contract automation, Makers streamlines administrative processes such as property acquisition, profit distribution, and ownership management.

With this solution, Makers redefines property ownership—transitioning from an exclusive and illiquid model to an inclusive, liquid, transparent, and data-driven framework accessible to anyone worldwide.

## Competitive Advantage

Makers delivers a set of competitive advantages that differentiate it from both traditional real estate ownership and other asset tokenization initiatives:

1.  **Blockchain-Based Fractional Ownership**
    
    -   Each property is divided into fractional units of ownership.
        
    -   Investors are not required to purchase entire properties; instead, they can acquire smaller fractions, lowering barriers to entry.
        
    -   This model democratizes access to real estate, serving both retail and institutional investors.
        
2.  **On-Chain Transparency**
    
    -   All ownership records, profit distributions, and occupancy data are stored immutably on the blockchain.
        
    -   Investors hold verifiable and tamper-proof proof of ownership with open auditability.
        
    -   Unlike traditional property investments, there is no “black box” in the process.
        
3.  **Liquidity Through Tokenization**
    
    -   Fractional ownership units can be traded on secondary marketplaces.
        
    -   This provides liquidity that is nearly impossible to achieve in conventional real estate investments.
        
    -   Investors can enter or exit positions seamlessly, without lengthy and costly property sale processes.
        
4.  **RWA Ecosystem on Sui Move**
    
    -   Built on the Sui blockchain with Move-based architecture, Makers benefits from high throughput, low transaction costs, and object-based security.
        
    -   This infrastructure enables scalable and efficient management of tokenized real-world assets.
        
5.  **Automated Profit-Sharing Model**
    
    -   Profits generated from property occupancy (e.g., tourist rentals) are distributed automatically via smart contracts.
        
    -   Investors receive proportional profit shares based on their fractional ownership holdings.
        
    -   This minimizes moral hazard by ensuring payouts are code-enforced rather than reliant on manual trust.
        
6.  **Tokenization Platform for Developers**
    
    -   Beyond tokenizing its own assets, Makers offers a ready-to-use infrastructure for developers, property entrepreneurs, or institutional players to tokenize their assets.
        
    -   The platform provides standardized smart contracts, compliance integration, and marketplace listing—making asset digitalization faster, simpler, and cost-efficient.
        
    -   This positions Makers as a key enabler of global RWA adoption.
        
7.  **Global Access, Local Scale**
    
    -   International investors can participate in Bali’s real estate market without physical presence or complex legal hurdles.
        
    -   Makers bridges global investor demand with high-value local markets driven by tourism.
        
8.  **Branding & First-Mover Advantage**
    
    -   Makers pioneers fractional real estate tokenization in Bali—one of the world’s top travel destinations.
        
    -   Early-mover positioning strengthens brand reputation, community base, and media visibility.
