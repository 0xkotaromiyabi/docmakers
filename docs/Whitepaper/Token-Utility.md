### Token Utility

### 1. Ownership Representation

-   Each villa is represented by **10,000 fractional dNFT units**. With a total of 40 villas, the ecosystem provides **250,000 dNFTs**.
    
-   dNFTs function as **immutable on-chain proof of ownership**, resistant to forgery or manipulation.
    
-   Holders of dNFTs own a proportional share of the physical asset relative to the number of dNFTs they possess.
    

----------

### 2. Automated Profit Distribution

-   Rental income from villa occupancy is automatically allocated via smart contracts.
    
-   Each month, revenues are converted into stablecoins (e.g., USDC on Sui) and distributed proportionally to dNFT holders.
    
-   Distributions are executed **trustlessly**, without reliance on third parties.
    

**Distribution Formula:**


----------

### 3. Liquidity & Secondary Market

-   Fractional dNFTs can be traded on secondary marketplaces, creating liquidity rarely available in traditional real estate investments.
    
-   Investors may partially or fully liquidate their holdings at any time without waiting for the physical property to be sold.
    

----------

### 4. Dynamic NFT (dNFT) Mechanism

dNFTs contain **dynamic metadata** that updates with real-time data, including:

-   **Occupancy Rates** (monthly rental activity),
    
-   **Property Market Valuation** (based on independent appraisals or local pricing),
    
-   **Profit Distribution History** (record of investor payouts).
    

This ensures investors maintain **full on-chain transparency** into asset performance.

----------

### 5. Makers as an Asset Tokenization Platform

Beyond fractional ownership of villas, Makers serves as a **comprehensive tokenization platform** for developers, institutional investors, and property owners.

-   **Asset Onboarding**: Developers can register physical assets (villas, apartments, hotels, or commercial properties) for tokenization into dNFTs.
    
-   **Tokenization-as-a-Service (TaaS)**: Makers provides end-to-end infrastructure—standardized smart contracts, SPV-based legal structures, integrated KYC/AML, and marketplace listings.
    
-   **Revenue Sharing Model**: Developers retain a share of property profits while global investors gain access to fractional ownership.
    
-   **Global Investor Access**: Physical assets previously restricted to local markets can now reach international investors via blockchain.
    

----------

### 6. Makers Economic Model

**a. Revenue Streams**

-   **Primary Revenue**: villa rental income,
    
-   **Secondary Revenue**: small transaction fees (0.5–1%) on dNFT trades in the official Makers marketplace,
    
-   **Service Fees**: operational property management costs, fully transparent via on-chain reporting,
    
-   **Platform Fees**: tokenization service fees for developers and property operators using Makers.
    

**b. Profit Distribution**

-   After deducting operational expenses, remaining profits are automatically distributed to dNFT holders.
    
-   No human intervention; all processes are executed through smart contracts.
    

**c. Value Appreciation**  
dNFT values may increase due to:

-   Rising physical property valuations,
    
-   Stable or growing occupancy rates,
    
-   Expanding global investor demand for Bali and other Makers ecosystem properties.
    

----------

### 7. Investor Benefits

-   **Diversification**: fractional access to multiple properties rather than a single unit,
    
-   **Liquidity**: tradable ownership in secondary markets at any time,
    
-   **Transparency**: all ownership, revenue, and valuation data is immutably recorded on-chain,
    
-   **Passive Income**: investors receive recurring profit shares without operational involvement.
    

**Conclusion:**  
Through this framework, Makers not only delivers **fractional property ownership** but also evolves into a **tokenization platform for real-world assets**, enabling developers and property owners to open global investment opportunities. The result is a more **inclusive, liquid, and transparent** real estate market in the blockchain era.
