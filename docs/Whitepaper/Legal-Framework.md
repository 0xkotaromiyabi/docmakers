# Legal Framework & Ownership Transition

### Legal Framework & Ownership Transition

In the context of **Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization**, legal and ownership aspects form a critical foundation. While **fractional ownership via blockchain** enables more accessible, liquid, and transparent property rights, implementation must remain aligned with the **legal framework of the asset’s jurisdiction**.

Makers ensures that every digital ownership representation through **dynamic NFTs (dNFTs)** is not detached from legal reality but serves as a **bridge between on-chain asset representation and off-chain legal enforceability**.

This section outlines the treatment of fractional ownership, mechanisms for transitioning into full ownership (100%), and distinctions in legal status for Indonesian citizens (WNI) and foreign nationals (WNA). It also emphasizes that full owners remain subject to property management rules of the apartment/resort, ensuring continuity and governance of physical assets.

----------

### Fractional Ownership via dNFT

All tokenized properties within Makers are represented as **fractional dynamic NFTs (dNFTs)**, which provide **economic rights** including:

-   Distribution of rental income,
    
-   Exposure to property value appreciation,
    
-   Transparent occupancy data.
    

Fractional dNFTs do not directly alter the legal status of land/building ownership under national land law; instead, they function as a **representative digital instrument**.

----------

### Transition to Full Ownership

When an investor consolidates **100% of the fractional dNFTs** of a villa or resort unit, they may execute a **full ownership claim** of the physical asset.

-   The claim process is conducted **off-chain** through local legal mechanisms (Indonesia or the jurisdiction of the asset).
    
-   Execution adheres to:
    
    -   Land and building regulations of the jurisdiction,
        
    -   Special provisions for foreign nationals,
        
    -   Applicable tax and property management laws.
        

----------

### Ownership Status for Indonesian Citizens (WNI)

Indonesian citizens may hold full property ownership under national land regulations, including:

-   **Hak Milik (HM)** – Freehold Title,
    
-   **Hak Guna Bangunan (HGB)** – Right to Build,
    
-   **Hak Pakai** – Right of Use (if the land belongs to another party).
    

Upon consolidating 100% dNFTs, a WNI investor may **re-register property ownership** with the **National Land Agency (BPN)** in accordance with applicable laws.

----------

### Ownership Status for Foreign Nationals (WNA)

Foreign nationals in Indonesia are subject to specific restrictions:

-   Cannot own land under **Hak Milik (HM)**,
    
-   May hold property through **Hak Pakai** (Right of Use) on state land or private land with agreements,
    
-   Alternatively, through a **foreign investment company (PT PMA)** or an **SPV** compliant with Indonesian investment law.
    

Within Makers, a WNA consolidating 100% dNFTs acquires **full economic rights**, while the **legal property claim** is executed through an SPV or other legally recognized structure.

----------

### Compliance with Property Management Rules

Whether WNI or WNA, full owners remain subject to apartment/resort management regulations, including:

-   Payment of maintenance fees,
    
-   Shared facility management,
    
-   Adherence to community regulations,
    
-   Restrictions on altering property use beyond its designated purpose.
    

----------

### Role of Makers

Makers operates as a **facilitator of asset tokenization** and **blockchain-based infrastructure provider**, not as a modifier of land law. Its role includes:

-   Validating full ownership claims,
    
-   Ensuring integration with national legal frameworks,
    
-   Providing legal support through notaries and regulators,
    
-   Maintaining transparency in ownership rights and obligations.
