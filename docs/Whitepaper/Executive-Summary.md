# Executive Summary


## Executive Summary

While blockchain adoption continues to grow, the bridge between digital innovation and tangible real-world assets remains underdeveloped. Makers emerges to close this gap by introducing a transparent, secure, and verifiable framework for property ownership through fractionalized representation of physical assets.

Makers is designed to revolutionize the ownership and investment of real-world assets (RWA) through blockchain-based digitalization. The platform enables fractional ownership of physical assets, starting with premium resorts and villas directly owned by Makers. Each property is represented as a dynamic digital record that allows users to track ownership, monitor asset valuation changes, and view occupancy rates with full transparency and real-time accuracy.

Beyond its own portfolio, Makers also functions as an open platform for property developers and entrepreneurs seeking to tokenize their physical assets. By providing an efficient, secure, and cost-effective framework, Makers streamlines the digitalization process while unlocking new opportunities for liquidity and accessibility in real estate markets.

This dual role—as both an asset owner and a service provider—positions Makers at the forefront of bridging the physical and digital worlds in real estate investment. Makers’ core mission is to democratize access to high-value assets, enhance market liquidity, and foster a trusted, transparent ecosystem where anyone can participate through fractional ownership backed by real data and measurable benefits.

Unlike traditional real estate investment methods, Makers delivers:

-   **Fractional Ownership** – enabling participants to own portions of real properties without the need to acquire the asset in full.
    
-   **Transparency and Traceability** – ownership, asset condition updates, valuations, and occupancy rates are securely recorded on the blockchain.
    
-   **Liquidity** – fractionalized representation enhances flexibility, making ownership units tradable more efficiently than in conventional markets.
    
-   **Real-World Integration** – property data, valuations, and occupancy metrics are dynamically updated, providing investors with real-time insights.
    

Makers’ mission is to transform property ownership into a more accessible, liquid, and data-driven experience while laying the foundation for the broader adoption of real-world assets within the blockchain ecosystem.

## Problem Statement

The global real estate market is one of the most valuable asset classes, yet remains among the most inaccessible. Current barriers to property ownership include:

-   **Limited Accessibility** – High property prices restrict ownership to individuals or institutions with substantial capital.
    
-   **Low Liquidity** – Real estate is inherently illiquid; selling assets is time-consuming and fractional trading is rarely feasible.
    
-   **Lack of Transparency** – Ownership data, physical condition, valuations, and occupancy rates are often unavailable, outdated, or opaque.
    
-   **Regulatory and Administrative Complexity** – Purchasing, leasing, and managing properties involve multiple intermediaries and bureaucratic layers that slow transactions.
    
-   **Limited Investment Innovation** – Traditional real estate investment models rely on outdated structures that fail to leverage digital technologies for efficiency and openness.
